# HTMLProject
# Through this project for my MIS2402 class, I had a create a website which discussed the history
# or timeline of anything technology related, so I decided to make my one based on the history 
# of videogame UI. The primary purpose of this website was to learn how to implement 
# very basic JavaScript into HTML code, and we were tasked to do this by creating a 
# JavaScript form.
